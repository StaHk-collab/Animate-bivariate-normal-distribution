# Animate-bivariate-normal-distribution (Task 1)

## Libraries used :
JAX, NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy 

## Steps :

1. Defining limits of plotting
2. Considering a 2-d Mean and covariance matrix
3. 1-d PDFs for the "walls" of the graph
4. 2-d samples for the "floor" of the graph
5. Creating sigma ellipses by transforming a circle by the cholesky decomposition
6. Plotting the samples on the "floor" of the graph
7. Plotting the histograms on both the walls (i.e, on XZ and YZ plane) from the data in the middle
